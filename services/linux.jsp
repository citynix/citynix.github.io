	    Whether you are looking for help with Redhat Enterprise linux 
	    consulting, or looking to install Ubuntu for the first time, our 
	    team can help.  With experience using a variety of linux distributions, 
	    CityNix can help you or your company make the switch to linux or 
	    help with any linux changes that might be necessary and provide you 
	    the support to smooth over any transitions.  If you need server, 
	    workstation, desktop or laptop installations, we can help analyse your 
	    position to determine the distribution and setup which best matches your needs.

	    and anti-virus software, and you think seeing the best performance 
	    from your hardware sounds good, don't hesitate to let us know and 
	    we'll see how we can help you out.
